# Store screenshots

Upload the files in their order. They are slices of one wide picture, so the order matters.

- `ios/`: App Store, 6.9-inch iPhone, 1320 × 2868.
- `ios-6.3/`: App Store, 6.3-inch iPhone, 1206 × 2622. Use this set if App Store Connect asks for
  the 6.1-inch or the 6.3-inch display.
- `play/`: Google Play, phone, 1080 × 1920.

Each `panorama.png` is the whole picture. Keep it for reference.

## How to make them again

The raw screens come from the web export of the mobile app, at the size of an iPhone. The capture hides the Ko-fi link, because the iOS app does not show it.

```bash
npm run calendar -- --release
(cd apps/mobile && npx expo export -p web --output-dir dist)
# Serve apps/mobile/dist with a fallback to index.html, on port 18186.
node store/screenshots/capture.cjs store/screenshots/raw      # needs playwright
node store/screenshots/compose.cjs store/screenshots/config.json store/screenshots   # needs sharp
```

`compose.cjs` needs the fonts Inter and Source Serif 4. `config.json` holds the colours, the
headlines and the order of the screens.
